# Data-Analysis-PowerBI-Dashboard-
I built a comprehensive Power BI project focused on agricultural data analysis for the period 1997 to 2020. The workflow involved data processing, cleaning, and transformation to prepare a reliable dataset, followed by data modeling for accurate relationships and calculations. Finally, I designed interactive dashboards with charts, KPIs, and filters to uncover key trends, compare state and crop performance, and deliver actionable insights in a visually compelling format.
