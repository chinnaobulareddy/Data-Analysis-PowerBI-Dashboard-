# Data-Analysis-PowerBI-Dashboard-
I built a comprehensive Power BI project focused on agricultural data analysis for the period 1997 to 2020. The workflow involved data processing, cleaning, and transformation to prepare a reliable dataset, followed by data modeling for accurate relationships and calculations. Finally, I designed interactive dashboards with charts, KPIs, and filters to uncover key trends, compare state and crop performance, and deliver actionable insights in a visually compelling format.
## Dataset Used
-<a href="https://github.com/chinnaobulareddy/Data-Analysis-PowerBI-Dashboard-/blob/main/Agriculture%20Dataset123.xlsx"> Agriculture data from 1997-2020</a>
# Project Overview
This project analyzes agricultural production across Indian states and districts using a large dataset of crop production records. The interactive Power BI dashboard helps visualize key trends, top-performing states/crops, and year-over-year production patterns.
The goal is to make agricultural insights easy to understand for policymakers, researchers, and students.
# Power BI Dashboard Features 
The dashboard provides interactive insights such as:
State-wise and District-wise Production – Visual maps & bar charts
Top Crops – Identify top-performing crops per state
Year-over-Year Analysis – See growth trends over time
Seasonal Insights – Compare Kharif vs Rabi production
KPIs – Total Production, Average Yield, Cultivated Area
Absolutely! Based on your dataset (**1997–2020**), here’s a well-structured **Insights section** you can include in your README:
Here’s a set of **clear and professional insights** based on your screenshot:

## 🔍 Key Insights from Dashboard (1997–2020)

* **🌾 Top 10 Agriculturally Leading States:**

  * **Kerala** leads with the highest production, followed by **Tamil Nadu**, **Karnataka**, and **Andhra Pradesh**.
  * States like **Uttar Pradesh**, **West Bengal**, and **Maharashtra** are also among the top contributors.
  * Even smaller regions like **Goa** and **Andaman & Nicobar Islands** make it to the top 10, highlighting diverse agricultural activity.

* **📊 Total Production:**

  * Cumulative production across all states and years is **327.25 billion tons**, showing the massive scale of Indian agriculture.

* **📈 Crop-Wise Performance:**

  * **Rice (2.24T)** and **Wheat (2.00T)** dominate overall production, forming the backbone of Indian agriculture.
  * **Sugarcane (725B)** and **Maize (44B)** are also major contributors, crucial for food security and allied industries.
  * Commercial crops like **Cotton (53B)** and **Jute (23B)** remain significant for India’s textile economy.

* **📅 Seasonal Analysis:**

  * Majority of production comes from **Whole Year crops** (97%), indicating that perennial and multiple-season crops (e.g., sugarcane, coconut, banana) have the largest share in total yield.
  * **Kharif and Rabi** seasons contribute smaller but vital portions for food grains and pulses.

* **🌱 Crop Diversity:**

  * A total of **57 crops** are cultivated, showing rich agricultural diversity across states and climatic zones.

* **📊 Average Yield:**

  * The **average yield is 81.19** (tons per hectare), indicating overall good productivity with scope for improvement in certain regions
